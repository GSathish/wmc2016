    <td>Daniel Gracia Pérez is a Research Engineer at THALES (France) with a PhD on Computer Architecture from Paris XI University and engineer degrees from the Kungliga Teckniska Högskolan (KTH, Sweden) and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC, Spain). Previous professional experience include as researcher the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA, France), where he participated at the creation of the UNISIM micro-architecture simulation environment, and as engineer in Philips (France) and Ericsson (Sweden). He participated in the creation of the UNISIM project, while working at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). He has participated in various French and European projects including ANR SoCLib (workpackage coordinator), ANR Hecosim (workpackage coordinator), CATRENE COMCASS, OPEES, ITEA TWINS, FP7 Certainty and FP7 DREAMS. He is also member of the HiPEAC network, where he has participated at the organization of various conferences and events. His current research consist on the development and application of new multi-core architectures for safety-critical systems. His research interests include computer architecture, networks on chip design, simulation, genetic algorithms and neural networks.</td>
