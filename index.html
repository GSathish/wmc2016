<h3>THEMES</h3>

The workshop aims to bring together researchers working in fields relating to real-time systems with a focus on the challenges brought about by the integration of mixed criticality applications onto single-core, multi-core and many-core architectures. These challenges are cross-cutting. To advance rapidly, closer interaction is needed between the sub-communities involved in real-time operating systems / run-time environments / hypervisor, real-time scheduling, security, safety and timing analysis. The workshop aims to promote understanding of the fundamental problems that affect Mixed Criticality Systems (MCS) at all levels in the software/hardware stack and crucially the interfaces between them. The workshop will promote lively interaction, cross fertilisation of ideas, synergies, and closer collaboration across the breadth of the real-time community, as well as attracting industrialists from the aerospace, automotive and other industries with a specific interest in MCS. Original unpublished papers on all aspects of mixed criticality real-time systems are welcome. Themes include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Task and system models for MCS on single-core, multi-core, and many-core platforms.</li>
<li>Comparison between MCS models (Vestal, DAL / IMA, SIL / AUTOSAR, â€¦). </li>
<li>Scheduling schemes and analyses for MCS, including the integration of appropriate models of overheads and delays.</li>
<li>Operating systems, hypervisors, run-time environments and support for MCS.</li>
<li>Communication on Network on Chip (NoC) in MCS</li>
<li>Analysis of worst-case execution times (WCET) relating to MCS.</li>
<li>Certification issues of MCS on multi-core and many-core platforms.</li>
<li>Safety and fault-tolerance mechanisms for real-time MCS systems.</li>
<li>Probabilistic analysis techniques for MCS.</li>
</ul>
The scope of the workshop is real-time, mixed criticality systems. Papers that do not relate to real-time behaviour (i.e. are solely about security or safety aspects of MCS) will be considered as out of scope.


<h3>PAPER SUBMISSION</h3>

Submissions must be in the same format as in the final	proceedings (6 pages maximum, 2	columns, 10 pt, US Letter) compliant with IEEE formatting guidelines. Papers exceeding the page limit will not be reviewed.

The material must be unpublished and not under	submission elsewhere. By submitting a paper, the authors confirm that if the paper is accepted, at least one author will register for the WMC 2016 workshop by the special registration deadline set in the notification of acceptance, and present the paper at the workshop in person.

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format.

<h3>PROCEEDINGS</h3>

WMC will publish informal proceedings. The authors retain the copyright to their work and are free to submit extended versions to a conference or journal.
