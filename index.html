<h3>PURPOSE OF THE WORKSHOP</h3>

The purpose of WMC is to share new ideas, experiences and information about research and development of Mixed Criticality real-time systems.

<h3>IMPORTANT DATES</h3>

<ul>
<li>Submission deadline: 2nd October 2016 (23:59 GMT-12.00)</li>
<li>Notification of acceptance: 23rd Oct 2016</li>
<li>Final version: 4th November 2016</li>
<li>Workshop: 29th November 2016</li>
<li>RTSS 2016: November 30 -- December 2, 2016</li>
</ul>

<h3>THEMES</h3>

The workshop aims to bring together researchers working in fields	relating to real-time systems with a focus on the challenges brought	about by the integration of mixed criticality applications onto	singlecore, multicore and manycore architectures. These challenges are	cross-cutting.

To advance rapidly, closer interaction is needed between the	sub-communities involved in real-time scheduling, real-time operating	systems / runtime environments, and timing analysis. The workshop aims	to promote understanding of the fundamental problems that affect Mixed	Criticality Systems (MCS) at all levels in the software/hardware stack	and crucially the interfaces between them.

The workshop will promote lively interaction, cross fertilisation	of ideas, synergies, and closer collaboration across the breadth of	the real-time community, as well as attracting industrialists from the	aerospace, automotive and other industries with a specific interest in	MCS. Original unpublished papers on all aspects of mixed criticality	real-time systems are welcome.

Themes include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Task and system models for MCS on singlecore, multicore, and manycore platforms.</li>
<li>Scheduling schemes and analyses for MCS, including the integration of appropriate models of overheads and delays.</li>
<li>Run-time environments and support for MCS, including data exchange and synchronisation across criticality levels, and issues relating to	criticality mode.</li>
<li>Analysis of worst-case execution times (WCET) relating to MCS.</li>
<li>Mixed criticality communications mechanisms and analysis, including Network-on-Chip support.</li>
<li>Probabilistic analysis techniques for MCS.</li>
</ul>

The scope of the workshop is real-time, mixed criticality systems. Papers that do not relate to real-time behaviour (i.e. are solely about security or safety aspects of MCS) will be considered as out of scope.

<h3>PAPER SUBMISSION</h3>

Submissions must be in the same format as in the final	proceedings (6 pages maximum, 2	columns, 10 pt, US Letter) compliant with IEEE formatting guidelines. Papers exceeding the page limit will not be reviewed.

The material must be unpublished and not under	submission elsewhere. By submitting a paper, the authors confirm that if the paper is accepted, at least one author will register for the WMC 2015 workshop by the special registration deadline set in the notification of acceptance, and present the paper at the workshop in person.

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format.

<h3>PROCEEDINGS</h3>

WMC will publish informal proceedings. The authors retain the	copyright to their work and are free to submit extended versions to a conference or journal.
